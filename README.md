Admin Dashboard Project for TOP Curriculum

Goal is to recreate the given design layout (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) using predominantly grid.

This one is made only with grid - no flexbox (and I wanted to use flexbox so badly).
